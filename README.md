# WWII Weather Regression Project

This is a simple project for practicing regression.  
I explored the **World War II Weather Conditions dataset** with some basic **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and then trained a regression model.  

## Dataset
- Source: [Weather Conditions in World War Two on Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/usaf/world-war-ii](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smid80/weatherww2/data))  
- Contains daily weather records (temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.) from various stations during WWII.

## Project Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
3. Training a regression model  
4. Evaluating model performance  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

(You can install everything with `pip install -r requirements.txt` if provided.)

## Notes
This project was made mainly for **learning and practice purposes**, not as a professional or production-ready solution.
